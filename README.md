# Seattle-Real-Time-Parking-Availability-Web-Application

This project aims to provide users with real-time information about the parking availability of each Park and Ride facility in the Greater Seattle Area.

The link to the app is https://angieniu.github.io/EZPark-Ride/

Demo of this app: https://youtu.be/0ETBjdwgXzU

This application visualizes real-time parking availability data every 30 seconds. 

I was the lead software engineer and user experience researcher in the team and collaborated with other data scientist, data engineer, and cloud engineer to develop the project.

My experience in this project reflects my past. I studied history and anthropology and did social science research for almost ten years. In the whole process, I enjoyed listening to what people were talking about, and observing what people were experiencing, because I always cared about people and their needs. When I started to learn information science and web development, I feel very excited to be able to make actionable solutions through my own implementation and build things to help people address their needs in real life.

In the process of designing and building this project, I became more and more enthusiastic about web development and developed deeper understanding about web development in a systematic way. Every time I solved certain technical problems, I was so excited and also did self-reflection for further improvement. ðŸ˜Š
