# Seattle-Real-Time-Parking-Availability-Web-Application

This project aims to provide users with real-time information about the parking availability of each Park and Ride facility in the Greater Seattle Area.

The link to the app is https://angieniu.github.io/EZPark-Ride/

Demo of this app: https://youtu.be/0ETBjdwgXzU

This application visualizes real-time parking availability data every 30 seconds. The custom data is generated to test the application.

I created this project because I studied history and anthropology and did social science research for almost ten years. In the whole process, I enjoyed listening to what people were talking about, observing what people were experiencing, because I always care about people and their needs. When I started to learn information science and web development, I feel very excited to be able to make actionable solutions through my own implementation and build things to help people address their needs in real life.

I was experiencing something very difficult in my life at the time when I started to do this project. However, in the process of designing and building this project, I became more and more enthusiastic about web development and developed deeper understanding about web development in a systematic way. Every time I solved certain technical problems, I was so excited and also did self-reflection for further improvement.

Right now, I feel my life is brightened because of all the efforts I have made in the whole process. ðŸ˜Š

I want to give my special thanks to Professor Nick DeNardis, who guided me all the way patiently and creatively. When there were some challenges which I spent many hours trying to solve, Nick was always very helpful to provide useful resources and thoughts which inspired me to conquer each challenge.

Now, the project I made is being integrated into a larger team project. I am the software engineer and user experience researcher in the team and collaborating with other data scientist, data engineer, and cloud engineer to develop the project to the next level.
Note:
Some specifics about this project:

1. A grid of items are displayed in both the main page and the "about" page and they are available on small, medium, and large devices.
2. Bootstrap framework is used to style the pages.
3. A .js file contains an array of park and rides data, which is displayed on the main page with JS.
4. A open text search bar and a dropdown filter could be seen in the main page for users to filter information about Park and Rides based on availability, name, zip code, and address.
5. Data from King County API is imported to this project for use.
6. All the pages are checked as valid HTML through validator.
7. All the pages are responsive at multiple screen sizes.
8. This app has three pages with internal links connecting them together.
9. There are two sources of data, one is stored in a Javascript array, the other is pulled in through external King County API.
