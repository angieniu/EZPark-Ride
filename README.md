# Seattle-Real-Time-Parking-Availability-Web-Application

This project aims to provide users with real-time information about the parking availability of each Park and Ride facility in the Greater Seattle Area.

This application visualizes real-time parking availability data every 30 seconds. The custom data is generated to test the application.

I created this project because I studied history and anthropology and did social social research for almost ten years. In the whole process, I enjoyed listening to what people were talking about, observing what people were experiencing, because I always care about people and their needs. When I started to learn information science and web development, I feel very excited to be able to make actionable solutions through my own implementation and build things to help people address their needs in real life.

I was experiencing something very difficult in my life at the time when I started to do this project. However, in the process of designing and building this project, I became more and more enthusiastic about web development and developed deeper understanding about web development in a systematic way. Every time I solved certain technical problems, I was so excited and also did self-reflection for further improvement.

Right now, I feel my life is brightened because of all the efforts I have made in the whole process. ðŸ˜Š

I want to give my special thanks to Professor Nick DeNardis, who guided me all the way patiently and creatively. When there were some challenges which I spent many hours trying to solve, Nick was always very helpful to provide useful resources and thoughts which inspired me to conquer each challenge.

Now, the project I made is being integrated into a larger team project. I am the software engineer and user experience research in the team and collaborating with other data scientist, data engineer, and cloud engineer to develop the project to the next level.
